- Here is a [list of the Unix(R)
Utilities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Unix_commands).  It's
sortable on its five columns
- And from Cat-v, manys slice at the [Versions of Unix](https://man.cat-v.org/)
- In full disclosure, I was a voting member of
[Posix.1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIX) and a committee member
of Posix.3, now called POSIX VCTS.

Here's the [Table of Contents](./Development.html)
