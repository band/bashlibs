# Bash Shell Libraries

This new Bash Shell Libraries upgrades the Shell Functions e-book. To
support the diverse development needs, the focus shifts to separate
libraries supporting the various needs of Shell developers.

At bottom, it recognizes three needs of a Shell developer independent
of their own application development families.

- backing up functions, libraries, and ancillary files: images,
  spreadsheets, ...
- converting function libraries, their collections, into Apps
- producing a library/function data base, it uses the Unix Relational
  Data Base

Here is this folder's [Table of Contents](./index.html)  

## Dcoument Conventions

Here we specify the formating required for each identified document obuject:

- any file
- user function
- system command, utility name
- user-define App
- included source file markdown format
- internal section reference
- url, local
- url, public
