# README

This `src` directory holds source code for the first version of Shell
Libraries, Edition 2.

The shell libraries in this tree are a combination of source code from
Marty McGowan's _Bash Shell Libraries_, additional and refactored code
developed by Bill Anderson.

See "Notice.txt" for a description of how LLM systems were used in the
development and testing of these shell libraries.
