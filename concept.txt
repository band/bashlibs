## reference, definition

Each file may have `Reference`, `Definition`, and `deprecated`
sections where references need link to a definition, definition shows
satisfying link.  The deprecated section may be commented out.

## Reference


 While the temptation is strong to describe the development
cycle, that process is finding its way to a separate document.
